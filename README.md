# Pizza Sales Analysis Project with SQL & Power-BI

## Overview

This project analyzes pizza sales data to uncover insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. By leveraging SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can enhance sales strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing the following columns:

- **pizza_id**: Unique identifier for each pizza.
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **pizza_name_id**: Identifier for the name of the pizza.
- **quantity**: Number of pizzas ordered.
- **order_date**: Date when the order was placed.
- **order_time**: Time when the order was placed.
- **unit_price**: Price per unit of the pizza.
- **total_price**: Total price for the order (quantity * unit price).
- **pizza_size**: Size of the pizza (e.g., small, medium, large).
- **pizza_category**: Category of the pizza (e.g., vegetarian, meat, specialty).
- **pizza_ingredients**: List of ingredients used in the pizza.
- **pizza_name**: Name of the pizza.

## Project Components

- **SQL Analysis**: SQL queries were used to clean, aggregate, and analyze the data. Key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and sales trends over time were calculated.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: A comprehensive dashboard was created in Power BI to visualize the findings. The dashboard includes:
  - Sales trends over time
  - Top-selling pizza types
  - Customer demographics
  - Geographic sales distribution

## Key Insights

- Identification of peak sales periods and trends.
- Analysis of customer preferences based on demographics.
- Recommendations for inventory management based on sales patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL**: For data extraction and manipulation.
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
